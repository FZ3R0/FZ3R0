### Accesing Files

1. First I will check that `FTP` port accesing with `anonymous` login and download the `chatserver.exe` and the `essfunc.dll` from it
    
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94720207/169436929-93cad986-8310-402d-aa84-c4f39d72d45c.png)
    
2. As this is a buffer overflow Lab, it seems we got out `.exe` and `.dll` to exploit, so, nothing much more to do here...
    
    - Note: It's a little bit obvious that this room is based on the "Vuln Server" exploit, using default port 9999 and `essfunc.dll`...
        
    - [**Click here to read the full write up I did of `Vuln Server`**](/Cyber-Security-&-Hacking/Buffer-Overflow/buffer-overflow.md)
    
        - I will use the same setup for `Vuln Server`:
        
            - Using Windows 10 Pro on a bare metal CPU
            - Using Kali Linux in a VMware Pro VM
        
        - So I will transfer the files to a folder to the Windows 10 and use from there `Immunity Debugger` and also run the `chatserver.exe` binary.

        - Easy!

### Buffer Overflow

- I will use the same steps used in `Vuln Server` lab... this steps work with allmost all the buffer overflow procedures:

- **Steps to conduct a buffer overflow:**

    1. Spiking - Method to find vuln part of the program
    2. Fuzzing - Send a bunch of characters and see if we can break it
    3. Finding the Offset - At what point did we break it
    4. Overwriting the EIP - Overwriting the Poiting Address and control it
    5. Finding Bad Characters - ...
    6. Finding the Right Module - ...
    7. Generating Shellcode - Once we know the bad characters and right module we can generate a shellcode
    8. Root!

### Spiking

- First of all, I will run `chatserver.exe` as administrator and then start `Immunity Debugger` and attach the program.

- Then, I will run the Immunity Debugger with "play".

        - Running and ready to go!

- On Kali Linux:

    1. Connect to ChatServer:
        
        - Using the IP Address of the Windows Machine **192.168.10.100** + VulnServer Port **9999** (Default)
            
        - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94720207/169188519-02fab4e5-91e4-4272-a788-9239ad878c4a.png)
           
        - On Kali: `nc -nv 192.168.1.100 9999`
            
        - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94720207/169448471-a117bef5-2d59-40e8-9a37-19f0aeb3b263.png)
 
 - **It looks that this program `Chat Server` take commands based on what you type AKA `strings` to generate a `username`**
 
 - **The username request a `max of 20 characters`**
 
     - This means, maybe the buffer overflow and/or the pointer of `EIP` that we need to exploit is located after those 20 characters...maybe 21...maybe 2739?, 666?!, who knows?!
     
     - So, **we will do our `spiking` process to know how many bytes do we need to crash the program `chatserver.exe`**
     
- For spiking we will use a tool called:

    - **`generic_send_tcp`** 

        - Usage:
        
            - `**./generic_send_tcp host port spike_script SKIPVAR SKIPSTR**`
            
| **Instruction**        | **Result**                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **./generic_send_tcp** | Command                    |
| **host**               | (Target) 192.168.1.100     |
| **port**               | (Target) 9999              |
| **spike_script**       | (Spike File) something.spk |
| **SKIPVAR**            | ()0                        |
| **SKIPSTR**            | ()0                        |

### Spike Script

- We will generate a file called "stats.spk"

```
s_readline();              <<<-----| 1. We will read the line
s_string("STATS ");        <<<-----| 2. We will take the string (STATS in this case)
s_string_variable("0");    <<<-----| 3. We will send a variable to the "STATS" string
```

- The trick for the spike is this:
