### Accesing Files

1. First I will check that `FTP` port accesing with `anonymous` login and download the `chatserver.exe` and the `essfunc.dll` from it

2. As this is a buffer overflow Lab, it seems we got out `.exe` and `.dll` to exploit, so, nothing much more to do here...
    
    - Note: It's a little bit obvious that this room is based on the "Vuln Server" exploit, using default port 9999 and `essfunc.dll`...
        
    - [**Click here to read the full write up of `Vuln Server`**](/Cyber-Security-&-Hacking/Buffer-Overflow/buffer-overflow.md)
    
        - I will use the same setup for `Vuln Server`:
        
            - Using Windows 10 Pro on a bare metal CPU
            - Using Kali Linux in a VMware Pro VM
        
        - So I will transfer the files to a folder to the Windows 10 and use from there `Immunity Debugger` and also run the `chatserver.exe` binary. 
        
        - Easy!

### Buffer Overflow

- I will use the same steps used in `Vuln Server` lab... this steps work with allmost all the buffer overflow procedures:

- **Steps to conduct a buffer overflow:**

    1. Spiking - Method to find vuln part of the program
    2. Fuzzing - Send a bunch of characters and see if we can break it
    3. Finding the Offset - At what point did we break it
    4. Overwriting the EIP - Overwriting the Poiting Address and control it
    5. Finding Bad Characters - ...
    6. Finding the Right Module - ...
    7. Generating Shellcode - Once we know the bad characters and right module we can generate a shellcode
    8. Root!
