# VLAN hopping

## What is VLAN Hopping Attack?

- VLAN hopping is a computer security exploit, a method of attacking networked resources on a virtual LAN (VLAN). 
- The basic concept behind all VLAN hopping attacks is for an attacking host on a VLAN to gain access to traffic on other VLANs that would normally not be accessible. 
- There are two primary methods of VLAN hopping: 
 
    1. Switch spoofing
    2. Double tagging. 
   
- Both attack vectors can be mitigated with proper switch port configuration.

## 

n a switch spoofing attack, an attacking host imitates a trunking switch[1] by speaking the tagging and trunking protocols (e.g. Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol, IEEE 802.1Q, Dynamic Trunking Protocol) used in maintaining a VLAN. Traffic for multiple VLANs is then accessible to the attacking host.
