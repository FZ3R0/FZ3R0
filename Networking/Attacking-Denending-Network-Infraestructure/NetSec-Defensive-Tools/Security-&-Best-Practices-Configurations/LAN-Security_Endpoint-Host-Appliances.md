### Network Attacks Today

- The news media commonly covers attacks on enterprise networks. 
- Simply search the internet for "latest network attacks" to find up-to-date information on current attacks. 
- Most likely, these attacks will involve one or more of the following:

    - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
        
        - This is a coordinated attack from many devices, called zombies, with the intention of degrading or halting public access to an organizationâ€™s website and resources.

    - Data Breach
    
        - This is an attack in which an organizationâ€™s data servers or hosts are compromised to steal confidential information.

    - Malware 
    
        - This is an attack in which an organizationâ€™s hosts are infected with malicious software that cause a variety of problems. 
        - For example, ransomware such as WannaCry, shown in the figure, encrypts the data on a host and locks access to it until a ransom is paid.
