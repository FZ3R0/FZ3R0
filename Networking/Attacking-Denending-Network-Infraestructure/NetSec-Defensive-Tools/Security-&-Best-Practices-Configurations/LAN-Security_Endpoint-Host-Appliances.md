### Network Attacks Today

- The news media commonly covers attacks on enterprise networks. 
- Simply search the internet for "latest network attacks" to find up-to-date information on current attacks. 
- Most likely, these attacks will involve one or more of the following:

    - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
        
        - This is a coordinated attack from many devices, called zombies, with the intention of degrading or halting public access to an organizationâ€™s website and resources.

    - Data Breach
    
        - This is an attack in which an organizationâ€™s data servers or hosts are compromised to steal confidential information.

    - Malware 
    
        - This is an attack in which an organizationâ€™s hosts are infected with malicious software that cause a variety of problems. 
        - For example, ransomware such as WannaCry, shown in the figure, encrypts the data on a host and locks access to it until a ransom is paid.

### Network Security Devices

- Various network security devices are required to protect the network perimeter from outside access. 
- These devices could include a `virtual private network (VPN) enabled router`, a `next-generation firewall (NGFW)`, and a `network access control (NAC)` device.

    - **Virtual Private Network (VPN) enabled router**  
        - A VPN-enabled router provides a secure connection to remote users across a public network and into the enterprise network. 
        - VPN services can be integrated into the firewall.
       
    - **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**
        - An NGFW provides stateful packet inspection, application visibility and control, a next-generation intrusion prevention system (NGIPS), advanced malware protection (AMP), and URL filtering.

    - **Network Access Control (NAC)**
        - A NAC device includes authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. 
        - In larger enterprises, these services might be incorporated into an appliance that can manage access policies across a wide variety of users and device types. 
        - The Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) is an example of a NAC device.

### Endpoint Protection

- LAN devices such as switches, wireless LAN controllers (WLCs), and other access point (AP) devices interconnect endpoints. Most of these devices are susceptible to the LAN-related attacks that are covered in this module.

- But many attacks can also originate from inside the network. 
- If an internal host is infiltrated, it can become a starting point for a threat actor to gain access to critical system devices, such as servers and sensitive data.

    - **Endpoints:**

        - Endpoints are hosts which commonly consist of laptops, desktops, servers, and IP phones, as well as employee-owned devices that are typically referred to as bring your own devices (BYODs). 
        - Endpoints are particularly susceptible to malware-related attacks that originate through email or web browsing. 
        
            - **These endpoints have typically used traditional host-based security features, such as antivirus/antimalware, host-based firewalls, and host-based intrusion prevention systems (HIPSs).** 
        
            - **However, today endpoints are best protected by a combination of NAC, host-based AMP software, an email security appliance (ESA), and a web security appliance (WSA).** 
            - **Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) products include endpoint solutions such as Cisco AMP for Endpoints.**

- The figure is a simple topology representing all the network security devices and endpoint solutions discussed in this module.

### Cisco Email Security Appliance

- https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/email-security-appliance/data-sheet-c78-729751.html

- The Cisco ESA is a device that is designed to monitor Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). 
- The Cisco ESA is constantly updated by real-time feeds from the Cisco Talos, which detects and correlates threats and solutions by using a worldwide database monitoring system. 
- This threat intelligence data is pulled by the Cisco ESA every three to five minutes. 

    - These are some of the functions of the Cisco ESA:

        - Block known threats.
        - Remediate against stealth malware that evaded initial detection.
        - Discard emails with bad links (as shown in the figure).
        - Block access to newly infected sites.
        - Encrypt content in outgoing email to prevent data loss.

- In the figure, the Cisco ESA discards the email with bad links.

### Cisco Web Security Appliance

- https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/web-security-appliance/index.html

--- 

- The Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) is a mitigation technology for web-based threats. 
- It helps organizations address the challenges of securing and controlling web traffic. 
- The Cisco WSA combines advanced malware protection, application visibility and control, acceptable use policy controls, and reporting.

    - Cisco WSA provides complete control over how users access the internet. 
    - Certain features and applications, such as chat, messaging, video and audio, can be allowed, restricted with time and bandwidth limits, or blocked, according to the organizationâ€™s requirements. 
    - The WSA can perform blacklisting of URLs, URL-filtering, malware scanning, URL categorization, Web application filtering, and encryption and decryption of web traffic.

        - In the figure, an internal corporate employee uses a smartphone to attempt to connect to a known blacklisted site.
