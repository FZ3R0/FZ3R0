### Configure Cisco IOS DHCPv4 Server like a sir

- **Before anything else!**

    - Just as the redundancy in Layer 2 _(STP/Etherchannel in switches)_ you can configure redundancy on Layer 3 _(Routers)_ with **First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs)**. 

    - For example: 
    
        - If the gateway router (to Internet) goes down. None of your hosts can send any messages outside of the immediate network _(Internet or other VLANs)_. 
         
        - Itâ€™s going to take a while to get this default gateway router operating again, cuz you have the worst luck and the potato deosn't even turn on...RMA time... 
         
        - Tickets, calls and mails from people that doesn't even know a shit about computers are complaining because "it's you fault".
         
        - But the real problem here is that devices are not magical and sometimes shit happens... so, the solution:
         
            - We need to ask the CEO to invest in at least on **another Gateway Router, so we can configure a "mirror" or a `Redundancy of Routers` easy** and we can fight back against the worst luck it can exist: _"the luck of an engineer"_.
        
- **OK...let's keep going...**
