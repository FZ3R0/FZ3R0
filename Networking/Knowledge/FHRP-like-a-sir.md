### Configuration of FHRP & HSRP 

- **Before anything else!**

    - Just as the redundancy in Layer 2 _(STP/Etherchannel in switches)_ you can configure redundancy on Layer 3 _(Routers)_ with **First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs)**.
    
    - This protocols use  

    - For example: 
    
        - If the gateway router (to Internet) goes down. None of your hosts can send any messages outside of the immediate network _(Internet or other VLANs)_. 
         
        - Itâ€™s going to take a while to get this default gateway router operating again, cuz you have the worst luck and the potato deosn't even turn on...RMA time... 
         
        - Tickets, calls and mails from people that doesn't even know a shit about computers are complaining because "it's you fault".
         
        - But the real problem here is that devices are not magical and sometimes shit happens... so, the solution:
         
            - We need to ask the CEO to invest in at least **other Gateway Router, so we can configure it as a "mirror" or a `Redundancy of Routers`**, that's the way we can fight back against the worst luck it can exist: _"the luck of an engineer"_ and buy some time until we can replace the faulty Router. EZ!
        
- **OK...let's keep going...**

### Background Knowledge

### Default Gateway Limitations

- If a router or router interface (that serves as a default gateway) fails, the hosts configured with that default gateway are isolated from outside networks. 

- A mechanism is needed to **provide alternate default gateways in switched networks where two or more routers are connected to the same VLANs**. That mechanism is provided by **first hop redundancy protocols (FHRPs).**

- In a switched network, each client receives only one default gateway. There is no way to use a secondary gateway, even if a second path exists to carry packets off the local segment.

### The problem with PCs (or other device) and unique IP config

- End devices are typically configured with a single IPv4 address for a default gateway.

- This address does not change when the network topology changes. (so, how it will "know his way" to the "mirror" router?!) 

- If that default gateway IPv4 address cannot be reached, the local device is unable to send packets off the local network segment, effectively disconnecting it from other networks.

    - **Even if a redundant router exists that could serve as a default gateway for that segment, there is no dynamic method by which these devices can determine the address of a new default gateway.** 

- _Note: IPv6 devices receive their default gateway address dynamically from the ICMPv6 Router Advertisement._

### Router Redundancy

- One way to prevent a single point of failure at the default gateway is to implement a `virtual router`.

- To implement this type of router redundancy, **multiple routers are configured to work together to present the illusion of a single router to the hosts on the LAN**, as shown in the figure.

- By sharing an IP address and a MAC address, two or more routers can act as a single virtual router: 

    - That's why I called as a **"mirror"**: devices "think" that the same router stills there, even if the original router fails, the PC just notice a little "cut" of couple seconds in the connection.

- The IPv4 address of the virtual router _(Center Router)_ is configured as the default gateway for the workstations on a specific IPv4 segment.

- In a "normal" setup, when frames are sent from host devices to the default gateway, the hosts use ARP to resolve the MAC address that is associated with the IPv4 address of the default gateway _(MAC of the interface like Gi 0/1)_

- **But! with a virtual router is configured like a sir: the ARP resolution returns the `MAC address of the virtual router`.** _(NOT the physical interface, like MAC of Gi 0/1)_ 

### But how it works?!

- A redundancy protocol provides the mechanism for determining which router should take the active role in forwarding traffic. 

- It also determines when the forwarding role must be taken over by a standby router. 

- **The transition from one forwarding router to another is transparent to the end devices.**

- **The ability of a network to dynamically recover from the failure of a device acting as a default gateway is known as first-hop redundancy.**

### Steps for Router Failover

- When the `active router` fails, the redundancy protocol transitions the `standby router` to the `new active router` role, as shown in the figure. These are the steps that take place when the active router fails:

    1. The `standby router` **stops seeing Hello messages** from the `forwarding router`.

    2. The `standby router` **assumes the role** of the `forwarding router`.

    3. Because the `new forwarding router` **assumes both the IPv4 and MAC addresses of the virtual router**, the host devices see no disruption in service _(or maybe just a little micro tiny tiny cut)_.

### FHRP Options

- The FHRP used in a production environment largely depends on the equipment and needs of the network. 

- This are all the options available for First Hop Redundancy Protocols `FHRPs`.

1. **Hot Standby Router Protocol (`HSRP`)** 
2. **HSRP for IPv6 (`HSRP-IPv6`)**
3. **Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol v2 (`VRRPv2`)**
4. **Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol v3 (`VRRPv3`)**
5. **Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (`GLBP`)**
6. **GLBP for IPv6 (`GLBP-IPv6`)**
7. **ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (`IRDP`)**

### 1. Hot Standby Router Protocol (`HSRP`)

- HRSP is a Cisco-proprietary First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) that is designed to allow for transparent failover of a first-hop IPv4 device.

- HSRP provides high network availability by providing first-hop routing redundancy for IPv4 hosts on networks configured with an IPv4 default gateway address. 

- HSRP is used in a group of routers for selecting an active device and a standby device. 

- In a group of device interfaces, the active device is the device that is used for routing packets; the standby device is the device that takes over when the active device fails, or when pre-set conditions are met.

- The function of the HSRP standby router is to monitor the operational status of the First Hop Redundancy Protocols (HSRP) group and to quickly assume packet-forwarding responsibility if the active router fails.

### 2. HSRP for IPv6 (`HSRP-IPv6`)

- This is a Cisco-proprietary FHRP that provides the same functionality of HSRP, but in an IPv6 environment. 

- An HSRP IPv6 group has a virtual MAC address derived from the HSRP group number and a virtual IPv6 link-local address derived from the HSRP virtual MAC address. 

- Periodic router advertisements (RAs) are sent for the HSRP virtual IPv6 link-local address when the HSRP group is active. 

    - When the group becomes inactive, these RAs stop after a final RA is sent.

### 3. Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol v2 (`VRRPv2`)

- This is a non-proprietary election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for one or more virtual routers to the VRRP routers on an IPv4 LAN. 
- This allows several routers on a multiaccess link to use the same virtual IPv4 address.

### 4. VRRPv3

- This provides the capability to support IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. 
- VRRPv3 works in multi-vendor environments and is more scalable than VRRPv2.

### 5. Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)

- This is a Cisco-proprietary FHRP that protects data traffic from a failed router or circuit, like HSRP and VRRP, while also allowing load balancing (also called load sharing) between a group of redundant routers.

### 6. GLBP for IPv6

- This is a Cisco-proprietary FHRP that provides the same functionality of GLBP, but in an IPv6 environment. 
- GLBP for IPv6 provides automatic router backup for IPv6 hosts configured with a single default gateway on a LAN. 
- Multiple first-hop routers on the LAN combine to offer a single virtual first-hop IPv6 router while sharing the IPv6 packet forwarding load.

### 7. ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP)

- Specified in RFC 1256, IRDP is a legacy FHRP solution. IRDP allows IPv4 hosts to locate routers that provide IPv4 connectivity to other (nonlocal) IP networks.
