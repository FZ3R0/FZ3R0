## SNMP and RADIUS

- In this lab I will use `Simple Network Management Protocol` `SNMP` and `Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service` `RADIUS` server software. 

    - `SNMP` is used to monitor the network. 
    
        - The network administrator wants the `WLC` to **forward all `SNMP log messages`, called `traps`, to the `SNMP server`**.

    - In addition, for WLAN user authentication, the network administrator wants to use a `RADIUS` server for `authentication, authorization, and accounting` `AAA` services. 
    
        - Instead of entering a publicly known pre-shared key to authenticate, as they do with `WPA2-PSK`, users will enter **their own username and password credentials**. 
    
        - **The credentials will be verified by the RADIUS server.** 
        
    - This way, individual user access can be tracked and audited if necessary and user accounts can be added or modified from a central location. 
    
    - **The `RADIUS server` is required for WLANs that are using `WPA2 Enterprise` authentication**.
    
    - **In this lab I will NOT configure the RADIUS server or SNMP, I will do that on next lab and focus now on `WPA2 Enterprise Authentication` (Both servers are previusly configured and ready to go :D)**

## Objectives

- Configure a new VLAN interface on a WLC.
- Configure a new WLAN on a WLC.
- Configure a new scope on the WLC internal DHCP server.
- Configure the WLC with SNMP settings.
- Configure the WLC to user a RADIUS server to authenticate WLAN users.
- Secure a WLAN with WPA2-Enterprise.
- Connect hosts to the new WLC.

## Part 1: Create a new WLAN

- I will create a WLAN inside the WLC dashboard like a sir, just like in the previous lab. 

    - ## Step 1: Create a new VLAN interface.

        - **Each `WLAN` requires a `virtual interface` on the `WLC`.** 
        
            - **These interfaces are known as `dynamic interfaces`**. 
            
            - The virtual interface is assigned a `VLAN ID` and traffic that uses the interface will be tagged as `VLAN traffic`. 
            
            - **This is why connections between the APs, the WLC, and the router are over trunk ports.** 
            
            - For the traffic from multiple WLANs to be transported through the network, traffic for the WLAN VLANs must be trunked.

- Open the browser from the desktop of `Admin PC`. 

    - Connect to the IP address of the WLC over HTTPS. `https://192.168.200.254`

- Login with the username `admin` and password `Cisco123`.

- Click the Controller `menu` and then click `Interfaces` from the menu on the left. 

    - You will see the `default virtual interface` and the `management interface` to which you are connected.

    - Click the `New` button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. 
    
        - **You may need to scroll the page to the right to see it.**
        
        - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94720207/172333193-70b89efb-44e4-4efb-93ab-96b9805175bc.png)
        
        - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94720207/172333409-7076403f-7190-47dc-917c-41af01c42b62.png)

- Enter the name of the new interface. 

    - We will call it `WLAN-5`. 
    
    - Configure the `VLAN ID` as `5`. 
    
        - **This is the `VLAN` that will carry traffic for the `WLAN` that we create later. 
        
    - Click `Apply`. 
    
        - This leads to a configuration screen for the VLAN interface.
        
        - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94720207/172334030-30cc4da1-1f54-4b3d-91bc-7ff58a101369.png)

- First, configure the interface to use `physical port number` `1`. 

    - **Multiple VLAN interfaces can use the same physical port because the physical interfaces are like dedicated trunk ports.**
    
        - _That's why the `Fz3r0 Super Cisco Trunkin' Standard` uses `ALWAYS VLAN 99 for Trunk VLANs`_ 

- Address the interface as follows:

    - **IP Address: `192.168.5.254`**
    - **Netmask: `255.255.255.0`**
    - **Gateway: `192.168.5.1`**
    - **Primary DHCP server: `192.168.5.1`**
    
        - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94720207/172335214-653f1f8c-bdf2-45c5-bb40-21ade6bc8e3d.png)
