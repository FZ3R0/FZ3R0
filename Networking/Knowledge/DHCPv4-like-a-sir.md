### Configure Cisco IOS DHCPv4 Server like a sir:

- **< Option1: Straight to the point Configuration >**

- **< Option2: Step by Step Configuration >**

- **< Option3: Nerd Bible about this configuration >**

---

### Straight to the point:

- Cisco Router IOS:

```



```

---

### Step by Step:

- Steps to follow:

1. **Exclude IPv4 addresses.**
2. **Define a DHCPv4 pool name.**
3. **Configure the DHCPv4 pool.**

- Config Step by Step:

1. **Exclude IPv4 addresses:**
    - Exclude all the IPs used by other devices on the network
    - Select a range (or only 1 IP) that you want to exclude _(for example a pool of 20 IPs from 1.1.1.10-1.1.1.20)_

- Sintax:

```

Router(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address low-address [high-address]

```

- Copy:

```

enable
configure terminal
!
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.100
!
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.254
!
exit
!

```

2. **Define a DHCPv4 pool name.**

Configuring a DHCPv4 server involves defining a pool of addresses to assign.

### DHCPv4 Concepts

### DHCPv4 Server and Client

- DHCPv4 assigns IPv4 addresses and other network configuration information dynamically. 

- Because desktop clients typically make up the bulk of network nodes, DHCPv4 is an extremely useful and timesaving tool for network administrators.

- **DHCPv4 Server:**

    - A dedicated DHCPv4 server is scalable and relatively easy to manage. _(Windows Server, Thousand of linux DHCP servers, etc)_

    - **However, in a small branch or SOHO location, a Cisco router can be configured to provide DHCPv4 services without the need for a dedicated server. Cisco IOS software supports an optional, full-featured DHCPv4 server.**

    - The DHCPv4 server dynamically assigns, or leases, an IPv4 address from a pool of addresses for a limited period of time chosen by the server, or until the client no longer needs the address.
 
- **DHCPv4 Client:**

    - Could be any device with DHCP cappabilities like PCs, smartphones, IoT, etc.

    - Clients lease the information from the server for an administratively defined period. 

    - The lease is typically anywhere from 24 hours to a week or more. 

    - When the lease expires, the client must ask for another address, although the client is typically reassigned the same address.

### DHCPv4 Operation

- DHCPv4 works in a client/server mode: 

1. Client communicates with a DHCPv4 server 
2. Server assigns or leases an IPv4 address to that client. 
3. The Client connects to the network with that leased IPv4 address until the lease expires. 
    - The client must contact the DHCP server periodically to extend the lease. 
    - This lease mechanism ensures that clients that move or power off do not keep addresses that they no longer need. 
4. When a lease expires, the DHCP server returns the address to the pool where it can be reallocated as necessary.    

### Steps to Obtain a Lease

- When the client boots (or otherwise wants to join a network), it begins a four-step process to obtain a lease _(sending messages throught network)_:

1. DHCP **Discover** `DHCPDISCOVER`
    - **The client starts the process** using a broadcast DHCPDISCOVER message with its own MAC address to discover available DHCPv4 servers. 
    - The purpose of the DHCPDISCOVER message is to find DHCPv4 servers on the network.

2. DHCP **Offer** `DHCPOFFER`
    - When the DHCPv4 server receives a `DHCPDISCOVER` message, it reserves an available IPv4 address to lease to the client.
    - The server also creates an **ARP entry** consisting of the MAC address of the requesting client and the leased IPv4 address of the client. 
    - The DHCPv4 server sends the binding `DHCPOFFER` message to the requesting client.
3. DHCP **Request** `DHCPREQUEST`
    - When the client receives the `DHCPOFFER` from the server, it sends back a `DHCPREQUEST` message.
    - **This message is used for both lease origination and lease renewal. 
    - When used for lease origination, the DHCPREQUEST serves as a binding acceptance notice to the selected server for the parameters it has offered and an implicit decline to any other servers that may have provided the client a binding offer.
4. DHCP **Acknowledgment** `DHCPACK`
    - On receiving the DHCPREQUEST message, the server may verify the lease information with an ICMP ping to that address to ensure it is not being used already, it will create a new ARP entry for the client lease, and reply with a DHCPACK message.

### Steps to Renew a Lease

- **Prior to lease expiration**, the client begins a two-step process to renew the lease with the DHCPv4 server

1. DHCP Request (DHCPREQUEST)
    - Before the lease expires, the client sends a `DHCPREQUEST` message directly to the DHCPv4 server that originally offered the IPv4 address. 
    - If a `DHCPACK` is not received within a specified amount of time, the client broadcasts another `DHCPREQUEST` so that one of the other DHCPv4 servers can extend the lease.

2. DHCP Acknowledgment (DHCPACK)
    - On receiving the `DHCPREQUEST` message, the server verifies the lease information by returning a `DHCPACK`.

Note: These messages (primarily the DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK) can be sent as unicast or broadcast according to IETF RFC 2131.
