### Network Access Layer Issues  

- **Before anything!** 

    - This technique and simple command will be very useful in the whole Networking career fur sure... `show interface` _(options)_
    
    - **This can help a lot when a cable is damaged, a plug, a rat bite the wire, interferences, or something causing lose of packets or shitty transsmissions to be clear...**
     
    - The concept is very easy: if something is happening with the packets travelling throught our devices, we can identify the integrity of the transmission with a simple and mystic command `show interface`.
     
- **...OK let's move on...**

1. The output from the `show interfaces` command is useful for detecting common media issues. 
    - One of the most important parts of this output is the display of the `line` and `data link protocol` status, as shown in the example:

```

Fz3r0_Switch#
Fz3r0_Switch#
Fz3r0_Switch#show interfaces fastEthernet 0/10     <<<----------| Command


FastEthernet0/10 is up, line protocol is up (connected)  <<<----------| Interface # , UP/DOWN

Hardware is Lance, address is 00d0.badc.be0a (bia 00d0.badc.be0a)    <<<----| Interface MAC
  Description: << Testing Interface Fa 0/10 Issues >>     <<<----| Description

(more results explained in the next point!)

Fz3r0_Switch#

```

- `FastEthernet0/18 is up` refers to the hardware layer and indicates whether the interface is receiving a carrier detect signal.

- `line protocol is up` refers to the data link layer and indicates whether the data link layer protocol keepalives are being received.

- **Troubleshoot it!:**

    - Based on the output of the `show interfaces` command, possible problems can be fixed as follows:

- Interface `UP` / line protocol `DOWN`
    - There could be an encapsulation type mismatch, the interface on the other end could be error-disabled, or there could be a hardware problem.
    
- Interface `DOWN` / line protocol `DOWN`
    - A cable is not attached, or some other interface problem exists. 
    - For example, in a back-to-back connection, the other end of the connection may be administratively down.
    
- Interface `Administratively Down`
    - It has been manually disabled (the shutdown command has been issued) in the active configuration.
