### Network Access Layer Issues  

- **Before anything!** 

    - This technique and simple command will be very useful in the whole Networking career fur sure... `show interface` _(options)_
    
    - **This can help a lot when a cable is damaged, a plug, a rat bite the wire, interferences, or something causing lose of packets or shitty transsmissions to be clear... READ ON THE BOOTM TABLE ABOUT >> CRC ERRORS << (among others)...**
     
    - The concept is very easy: if something is happening with the packets travelling throught our devices, we can identify the integrity of the transmission with a simple and mystic command `show interface`.
     
- **...OK let's move on...**

1. The output from the `show interfaces` command is useful for detecting common media issues. 
    - One of the most important parts of this output is the display of the `line` and `data link protocol` status, as shown in the example:

```

Fz3r0_Switch#
Fz3r0_Switch#
Fz3r0_Switch#show interfaces fastEthernet 0/10     <<<----------| Command

FastEthernet0/10 is up, line protocol is up (connected)  <<<----------| Interface # , UP/DOWN

Hardware is Lance, address is 00d0.badc.be0a (bia 00d0.badc.be0a)    <<<----| Interface MAC

  Description: << Testing Interface Fa 0/10 Issues >>     <<<----| Description

(more results explained in the next point!)

Fz3r0_Switch#

```

- `FastEthernet0/18 is up` refers to the hardware layer and indicates whether the interface is receiving a carrier detect signal.

- `line protocol is up` refers to the data link layer and indicates whether the data link layer protocol keepalives are being received.

    - **Troubleshoot it!:**

        - Based on the output of the `show interfaces` command, possible problems can be fixed as follows:

            - Interface `UP` / line protocol `DOWN`
                - There could be an encapsulation type mismatch, the interface on the other end could be error-disabled, or there could be a hardware problem.
    
            - Interface `DOWN` / line protocol `DOWN`
                - A cable is not attached, or some other interface problem exists. 
                - For example, in a back-to-back connection, the other end of the connection may be administratively down.
    
            - Interface `Administratively Down`
                - It has been manually disabled (the shutdown command has been issued) in the active configuration.

### The real deal

- Now I will show the full command, not just the header:

- If something of the following is more than **0**.... run!!! _(Or check the hardware, cables, config...you know...follow the troubleshooting guidelines and your heart)_

| **Error Type**  | **Description**                                                                                            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Input Errors`    | **Total number of errors.** It includes runts, giants, no buffer, CRC, frame, overrun, and ignored counts.     |
| `Runts`           | Frames that are discarded because they are **smaller than the minimum frame size for the medium**. For instance, any Ethernet frame that is **less than 64 bytes is considered a runt**.  |
| `Giants`          | Frames that are discarded because they **exceed the maximum frame size for the medium**. For example, any Ethernet frame that is **greater than 1,518 bytes is considered a giant**.      |
| `CRC`             | **`VERY IMPORTANT TO CHECK!!!`** **CRC errors** are generated when the calculated **checksum is not the same** as the checksum received.                                                                                   |
| `Output Errors`   | **Sum of all errors** that prevented the final transmission of datagrams out of the interface that is being examined.                                                                 |
| `Collisions`      | Number of **messages retransmitted** because of an **Ethernet collision**.                                                                                                                |
| `Late Collisions` | A **collision** that occurs **after 512 bits of the frame have been transmitted**.  |

### Input errors

- **"Input errors"** is the sum of all errors in datagrams that were **received on the interface** being examined

- `Runt Frames` - Malfunctioning NICs are the usual cause of excessive runt frames, but they can also be caused by collisions.

- `Giants` - Ethernet frames that are larger than the maximum allowed size are called giants.

- `CRC errors` - **On Ethernet and serial interfaces, CRC errors usually indicate a MEDIA OR CABLE ERROR. 

- **CRC = cyclic redundancy checking** 

- **A CRC error informs you that the cyclic redundancy check has detected damaged or incomplete files.** 
    
    - Common causes include **electrical interference, loose or damaged connections, or incorrect cabling.** 
    
    - **If you see many CRC errors, there is too much noise on the link and you should inspect the cable.** 
    
    - **You should also search for and eliminate noise sources.** 

### Output errors 

- **"Output errors"** is the sum of all errors that **prevented the final transmission** (output) of datagrams out the interface that is being examined.

    - `Collisions`
        - Collisions in half-duplex operations are normal. However, you should never see collisions on an interface configured for full-duplex communication.

    - `Late collisions` 
        - A late collision refers to a collision that occurs after 512 bits of the frame have been transmitted. 
        - Excessive cable lengths are the most common cause of late collisions. 
        - Another common cause is **duplex misconfiguration.**
        -  A properly designed and configured network should **NEVER have late collisions.**

### Troubleshoot and relax! 

- When we find errors, issues, troubles & shit happen... don't panic, and then:

- General process shown in the figure:

- Actually....that's just an easy example, in each scenario you will need to imporvise...lol! prepare yourself, I'm telling you!!! Analyze every situation very well or you will be done...sometimes we are searching for rabbits in holes where there's nothing...
