### The boot system Command 

- **Before anything!** 

    - **This technique DO NOT reset the device to factory settings like new!**
    - **This is used to tell the router which IOS file to be used while booting, when there are multiple files in the flash... So, if you have only 1 file, it will be you same config!!! (not the factory or other startup config)**
    - **Other use is the boot from another disk or service outside the device like FTP, ROM, TFTP**

- The switch attempts to automatically boot by using information in the BOOT environment variable. 

    - If this variable is not set, the switch attempts to load and execute the first executable file it can find.

    - On Catalyst 2960 Series switches, **the image file is normally contained in a directory that has the same name as the image, but sometimes are directly in `/` **

- The IOS operating system then initializes the interfaces using the Cisco IOS commands found in the startup-config file. 
 
- **The `startup-config` file is called `config.text` and is located in `flash`.**

### Example:

- Notice that the IOS is located in a distinct folder and the folder path is specified. 

- Use the command **`show boot`** to see what the current IOS boot file is set to:

```

Switch> enable
Switch#
Switch# show boot
BOOT path-list      : 
Config file         : flash:/config.text    <<<-------| HERE!!!!! ;) 
Private Config file : flash:/private-config.text
Enable Break        : no
Manual Boot         : no
HELPER path-list    : 
Auto upgrade        : yes
NVRAM/Config file
      buffer size:   65536
Switch#

```

- Use **`dir flash:`** to do a ls/dir on the flash 

```

Switch#dir flash:
Directory of flash:/      <<<---------| in this case is directly in /

    3  -rw-   505532849          <no date>  cat3k_caa-universalk9.16.03.02.SPA.bin  <<<-----| The IOS file name!!! :D

1539575808 bytes total (1034042959 bytes free)
Switch#

```

- Now that we know which IOS file we want to choose _(in this example there's just 1)_ we can select in and reboot from it!

- For example, if you load a new .bin and we want to reboot form that binary , just paste that file name and boot from there: 

    - **HINT: Check the path!** if there's a folder, Paste it twice :)!!! The first is the directory (without .bin) the second is the file name:
    
    - **`flash:/cat3k_caa-universalk9.16.03.02.SPA/cat3k_caa-universalk9.16.03.02.SPA.bin`**

- **HINT: But sometimes is directly in /**

    - **`flash:/cat3k_caa-universalk9.16.03.02.SPA.bin`**
        
- Shake your Boot it!:
    
    - **`boot system flash:/cat3k_caa-universalk9.16.03.02.SPA/cat3k_caa-universalk9.16.03.02.SPA.bin`** 

```

Switch(config)# boot system flash:/cat3k_caa-universalk9.16.03.02.SPA/cat3k_caa-universalk9.16.03.02.SPA.bin

```
