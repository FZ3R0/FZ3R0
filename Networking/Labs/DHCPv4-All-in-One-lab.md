### Objectives:

1. Configure DHCP Servers:
    - Cisco Router as a DHCP Server
    - Generic _(Windows/Linux)_ Server as a DHCP Server
    - Home Router _(WiFi Modem)_ as a DHCP Server

3. Configure DHCP Relay
    - Cisco Routers as a DHCP Relay Agent

5. Configure DHCP Clients:
    - Cisco Router as a DHCP Client
    - Home Router _(WiFi Modem)_ as a DHCP Client
    - Generic DHCP Clients as PCs, Laptops, Smartphones, Printers, Tablets

---

### Scenario

1. Configuring a Cisco router as a DHCP server to provide dynamic allocation of addresses to clients on the network. 
2. Configure the **edge router as a DHCP client** so that it receives an IP address from the ISP network. 
3. Since the server is centralized, configure the two LAN routers to relay DHCP traffic between the LANs and the router that is serving as the DHCP server.

---

### Configuration

---

### R2 - Router 2 - `DHCP SERVER` 

1. Configure **R2** to **exclude the IPs** you need to take out
2. Create 2 different pools for 2 different VLANs (VLAN10 & VLAN20)
3. Configure the DHCP Pools including:
    - Network Address
    - Default Gateway
    - DNS Server IP
4. R2 needs to be configured to receive addressing from the ISP.

- **Note: R2 Will be the DHCP Server for the 2 different networks _(VLAN10 & VLAN20)_, and at the same time R2 will be recieving DHCP from the ISP Router _(Internet Cloud)_.**

```
