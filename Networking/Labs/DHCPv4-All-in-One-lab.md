### Objectives:

1. Configure DHCP Servers:
    
    - Big Enterprise:
        - `R2` - Cisco Router as a DHCP Server for Enterprise LAN (Including VLANs)
    
    - Small Business:
        - `Server1` - Generic _(Windows Server)_ as a DHCP Server
    
    - Home Sweet Home:
    - `Home WiFi1` - Home Router _(WiFi Modem)_ as a DHCP Server

3. Configure DHCP Relay:

    - `R1` & `R3` Cisco Routers (at Big enterprise) as a DHCP Relay Agent for DHCP between different Networks _(From centralized Edge Router **R2**)_

5. Configure DHCP Clients:
    - `R2` Cisco Router as a DHCP Client _(From ISP-Telmex)_
    - `Home Router` _(WiFi Modem)_ as a DHCP Client _(From ISP-Telmex)_
    - Generic DHCP Clients as PCs, Laptops, Smartphones, Printers, Tablets

---

### Scenario

1. Configuring a Cisco router as a DHCP server to provide dynamic allocation of addresses to clients on the network divided in 2 VLANs (VLAN10 & VLAN20).
 
2. Configure the **EDGE ROUTER as a DHCP client** (`R2`) so that it receives an IP address from the ISP network (Internet). 

3. Since the server is centralized, configure the two LAN routers (`R1` & `R3`) to relay DHCP traffic between the different LANs and the router that is serving as the DHCP server (`R2`).

---

### Configuration

---

### R2 - Router 2 - `DHCP SERVER` 

1. Configure **R2** to **exclude the IPs** you need to take out
2. Create 2 different pools for 2 different VLANs (VLAN10 & VLAN20)
3. Configure the DHCP Pools including:
    - Network Address
    - Default Gateway
    - DNS Server IP
4. R2 needs to be configured to receive addressing from the ISP.

- **Note: R2 Will be the DHCP Server for the 2 different networks _(VLAN10 & VLAN20)_, and at the same time R2 will be recieving DHCP from the ISP Router _(Internet Cloud)_.**
