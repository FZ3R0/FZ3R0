### Layer 2 MAC Flooding & ARP Spoofing

- **Before anything else!**

    - For the sake of this room, let's assume the following:

        - While conducting a pentest, you have gained initial access to a network and escalated privileges to root on a Linux machine. 
        - During your routine OS enumeration, you realize it's a dual-homed host, meaning it is connected to two (or more) networks. 
        - Being the curious hacker you are, you decided to explore this network to see if you can move laterally.
        
        - After having established persistence, you can access the compromised host via SSH:
        
            - `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new admin:Layer2$ip_target`
            
        - Note: The admin user is in the sudo group. I suggest using the root user to complete this room: `sudo su -`

- **OK...let's keep going...**

### Network Discovery

- As mentioned previously, the host is connected to one or more additional networks. You are currently connected to the machine via SSH on Ethernet adapter eth0. The network of interest is connected with Ethernet adapter eth1.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94720207/166306269-e37da4c6-7e21-4cda-bec2-8d9f098635d7.png)

1. First, have a look at the adapter:

    - `ip address show eth1` or the shorthand version: `ip a s eth1`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94720207/166290765-190266f9-0234-40ae-ad23-2bab0a5af312.png)

2. Now I will scan the Network using NMap to discover more hosts _(It's supposed that I don't know the topology at this point, so let's just rol play...)._

    - First I will use the IPv4 Address of the target machine (The machine I'm already in!) to check for more hosts in the Network who share the same `Network ID`.
     
    - The IP that we are using have the default Subnet Mask /24 Class C and is the typical "192.168.x.x", so it's very easy to figure out the Network ID and more:
    
        - PWNED host: `192.168.12.66/24`
        
        - Network ID: `192.168.12.0`
        - SubnetMask: `255.255.255.0` 
        - CIDR      : `/24`
        - Min Host  : `192.168.0.1`
        - Max Host  : `192.168.0.254`
        - Broadcast : `192.168.0.255`
        - Wildcard  : `0.0.0.255`
        
    - Fire in the hole:

- There are a total of 3 hosts in the Network:

    1. alice (192.168.12.1) MAC Address: 00:50:79:66:68:00 (Private)
    2. bob (192.168.12.2) MAC Address: 00:50:79:66:68:01 (Private)
    3. eve (192.168.12.66) _We are in this machine_
 
- I will scan each host:

1. First, I will scan "myself" `eve` (the machine where I logon with ssh & "gained" root privileges, it's supposed that we already have compromised that machine... but i don't know where i'm steping up, so!)

- There are some virtual Cisco Devices using a GNS3 setup for a Network Lab, and we are connected via SSH to the target, think it as a "pivot" to the cisco virtual devices & hosts configured as a network, but actually everything is just simulated inside the target machine, so we can experiment with it. (Beautiful work made by the author of this room! salute to you sir).

- Notice how 2 devices are using Telnet protocol, that means all the traffic sent between both hosts will be in plain text and we can sniff it, I think the room is going that way, I will continue to scan the other 2 hosts: 

2. Host: `alice` (192.168.12.1) MAC Address: 00:50:79:66:68:00 (Private)

3. Host: `bob` (192.168.12.2) MAC Address: 00:50:79:66:68:01 (Private)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94720207/166314835-1c7304f1-b55c-4ed9-af1f-00cc98d2a0e4.png)




- OK we have recognized all the hosts, we did't find something useful in last 2 hosts using NMap.

- However, **now we know the physical and logical topology of the Network and we can try to sniff the new broadcast domain we have discovered.**

---

### Passive Network Sniffing

- Simply scanning those hosts won't help us gather any useful information, and you may be asking, what could a pentester do in this situation? Depending on the rules of engagement and scope, you could try sniffing traffic on this network.

- The diagram below describes your current situation where you are the Attacker and have persistent access to eve.

- We will sniff on ETH1 as shown in the diagram:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94720207/166307336-66d2912d-1edf-4734-92d2-e386a21d1740.png)

- Let's try running tcpdump on the eth1 network interface:

    - `tcpdump -i eth1`

- Optionally, for a more verbose output that prints each packet (minus its link level header) in ASCII format:

    - `tcpdump -A -i eth1`

- **Now, let's take a closer look at the captured packets! We can redirect them into a pcap file providing a destination file via the `-w` argument:**

    - `tcpdump -A -i eth1 -w /tmp/tcpdump.pcap`
