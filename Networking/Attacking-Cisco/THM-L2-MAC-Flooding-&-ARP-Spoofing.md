### Layer 2 MAC Flooding & ARP Spoofing

- **Before anything else!**

    - For the sake of this room, let's assume the following:

        - While conducting a pentest, you have gained initial access to a network and escalated privileges to root on a Linux machine. 
        - During your routine OS enumeration, you realize it's a dual-homed host, meaning it is connected to two (or more) networks. 
        - Being the curious hacker you are, you decided to explore this network to see if you can move laterally.
        
        - After having established persistence, you can access the compromised host via SSH:
        
            - `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new admin:Layer2$ip_target`
            
        - Note: The admin user is in the sudo group. I suggest using the root user to complete this room: `sudo su -` 
        
- **OK...let's keep going...**

### Network Discovery

- As mentioned previously, the host is connected to one or more additional networks. You are currently connected to the machine via SSH on Ethernet adapter eth0. The network of interest is connected with Ethernet adapter eth1.

1. First, have a look at the adapter:

    - `ip address show eth1` or the shorthand version: `ip a s eth1`

2. Now I will scan the Network using NMap (This Network Scan is installed on the Linux machine I'm attacking, but i can send to the target any other scanner or even my super python scripts for NetScans_), I will use my Fz3r0's super script for CTF for sake of experimentation (Thread Destroyer T4)

    - First I will use the Network ID of the target machine (The machine I'm already in!) to check for more hosts in the Network who share my Network ID.
     
    - The IP have the default Subnet Mask /24 so it's very easy to figure out the Network ID:
    
        - PWNED host: `192.168.12.66/24`
        - Network ID: `192.168.12.0/24`
        
    - Fire in the hole:      




Now, use the network enumeration tool of your choice, e.g., ping, a bash or python script, or Nmap (pre-installed) to discover other hosts in the network and answer question #3.
